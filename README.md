# Work Experience 2024

Welcome to the Hartree Centre Data Science Work Experience.

## Your Task

Your task is to analyse the data from the _My Health My School_ survey with aim to improve the experience and wellbeing of students. The survey has responses from thousands of students across key areas like Healthy Eating, Physical Activity, PE and Sport, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco, Sexual Health, Social, Emotional and Mental Health, Safety and Anti-bullying. This is a group project to please work together.

You can find the data here [https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/emd7m/my-health-my-school-survey](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/emd7m/my-health-my-school-survey). On this webpage there are short PDF reports each year that may provide some inspiration.

## Getting Started

This repository contains two notebooks to help you get started. If have never used pandas before (which is a python library for working with tables) we suggest you start with the [Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb](Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb) notebook.

If you are comfortable using pandas, we suggest having a look at the [Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb](Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb). The aim of this notebook is to give you a place to start for how to tackle the data.

If you need help getting started please come and ask for help.
