# Work Experience 2024

Welcome to the Hartree Centre Data Science Work Experience.

## Your Task

Your task is to analyse the data from the _My Health My School_ survey with aim to improve the experience and wellbeing of students. The survey has responses from thousands of students across key areas like Healthy Eating, Physical Activity, PE and Sport, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco, Sexual Health, Social, Emotional and Mental Health, Safety and Anti-bullying. This is a group project to please work together.

You can find the data here [https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/emd7m/my-health-my-school-survey](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/emd7m/my-health-my-school-survey). On this webpage there are short PDF reports each year that may provide some inspiration.

You will be asked do a short presentation on Wednesday afternoon to introduce the other members of the data science group to your task and the approaches your are planning to take. Then, there will be a final presentation on Friday afternoon to to senior memebers of the data science group on everything you discovered. 

## Getting Started

This repository contains two notebooks to help you get started. If have never used pandas before (which is a python library for working with tables) we suggest you start with the [Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb](Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb) notebook.

If you are comfortable using pandas, we suggest having a look at the [Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb](Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb). The aim of this notebook is to give you a place to start for how to tackle the data but we encourage you to take your analysis in your own direction.

If you need help getting started please come and ask for help.

## Setting up your Environment (Without Git)

These instructions do not use git. If you are comfortable using git feel free to use it but please do not use your personal GitHub account, create a new one just for work experience.

1. Download python. We recommend using python 3.10 https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Check you have python installed by opening up the command prompt and typing `python`. You should see something similar (but not exactly the same) as the following. You can exit this using the `exit()` command.

```python
Python 3.10.14 (main, Mar 19 2024, 21:46:16) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```

3. Download this repository as a zip file by clicking the green `code` button then clicking `download zip`. If you are comfortable using git, feel free to use git instead here.
4. Move the and unzip the zip file into somewhere sensible like `Documents\work_experience_2024`.
5. From your command prompt, navigate to `Documents\work_experience_2024` using the `cd` command.
6. Create a python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`.
7. Activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate`.
8. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
9. Run jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` into the command prompt. You should then be able to select either the [Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb](Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb) or [Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb](Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb) notebook and get started.
